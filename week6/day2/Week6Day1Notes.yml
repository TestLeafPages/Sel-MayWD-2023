Todays agenda:

    9:30 - 10:00 -> Introduction to BDD
    10:00 - 10:30 -> How to generate feature file
    10:30 - 11:20 -> Breakout+Break
    11:20 - 12:00 -> Stepdefinition and Runner
    12:00 - 12:15 -> Breakout
    12:15 - 12:30 -> Parameterization


Steps :
  1.Create 3 packages for each layers of Cucumber
    -features
       - Create feature file -> Right click on features package->click New->click Other
       - click file under General folder-> Give filename->Login.feature
    -steps
       - Create StepDefintion class 
       - Create methods in the StepDefinition for each steps  in the Scenario
    -runner    


Parameterization:

   1. Identify the data in the feature file
       -username,password
   2. Surround the data with ''
   3. Replace the data which is surrounded with '' as {string} in the StepDefintion
   4. Pass input arguments to the method and replace the hardcoded data with the arguments


How to pass multiple data using ScenarioOutline:
1. To pass multiple data for a single scenario the Ghekin keyword used is Scenario Outline
2. In Scenario Outline identify the dynamic data and replace that with <>
    ex: <companyname>
3. Under Examples keyword create pipeline symbol and mention the column name
   ex: |companyname|
   Note: The nae should exactly match
    -Pass the values in the second row of Examples
    ex: |TestLeaf|  (1st set of data)
        |Qeagle|    (2nd set of data)

4.Go to the StepDefinition and replace <companyname> with (.*)$
5.Pass Input arguments to the method and replace the hardcoded value withe the argument        

InvalidMethodException:
  - You're not allowed to extend classes that define Step Definitions or hooks

Hooks Implementation:
   Cucumber Annotations - > Hooks in Ruby Language
   Hooks:
       @Before :
          -is to have common precondition for each scenario
        @After : 
           - is to have common postcondition for each scenario
